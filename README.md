# QuadFormSolver
Just a few programs I wrote to practice C programming.
First one accepts user input via scanf(). The second one accepts input via arguments.
Keep in mind, this will only solve for real solutions, meaning imaginary numbers will NOT work.
I may add support for imaginary numbers in the future.

# Compiling
To compile, use gcc and do:

`gcc -ansi -lm a.c`

or

`gcc -ansi -lm b.c`
